# Interactive Tavern Demo

A showcase of **Spark** (Gaussian Splats) + **Rapier Physics** + **Three.js** integration, demonstrating how to combine splat rendering with a collider mesh for simple physics.

## ðŸŒŸ Features

* **Gaussian Splat Rendering**: High-quality photorealistic environment using Spark library
* **Physics Simulation**: Realistic projectile physics and collision detection with Rapier
* **Animated Characters**: Interactive NPCs with bone-level collision detection
* **Spatial Audio**: Distance-based volume and velocity-based pitch modulation
* **Debug Visualization**: Toggle between splat rendering and collision mesh wireframes
* **First-Person Controls**: Smooth pointer-lock movement with WASD + mouse look

## ðŸŽ® Controls

* **Click**: Enter first-person mode / Shoot projectiles
* **WASD**: Move around the tavern
* **R/F**: Fly up and down
* **Space**: Toggle debug mode (collision mesh vs. splat rendering)

## ðŸ“š Educational Value

This demo serves as a practical example of:
- Integrating Gaussian splat rendering with traditional 3D graphics
- Setting up physics simulation with trimesh colliders
- Creating interactive audio systems with Web Audio API
- Implementing character animation with physics-based interactions
- Building debug tools for 3D development
